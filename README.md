## Aerofit

A company named AeroFit wants to identify the characteristics of the target audience for each type of treadmill offered by the company, to provide a better recommendation of the treadmills to the new customers.
I am hereby tryin to investigate whether there are differences across the product with respect to customer characteristics.

In this project I've performed descriptive analytics to create a customer profile for each AeroFit treadmill product by developing appropriate tables and charts.
